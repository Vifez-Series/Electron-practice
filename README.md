# Setup
I designed this practice core to be as dependency less as possible which is why it only requires the following:

- Packet events
- ProtocolLib
- 1.8
- MongoDB

# Compiling
- Clone the repo to your intellij
- Let maven do its magic
- run `mvn package`
- add `target/Practice-1.0.jar` to ur server
- add `libs/packetevents-2.7.0.jar` to ur server
- run ur server for configs to load, add mongo
- and boom... practice server!

# PLEASE NOTE
This is an older version of the core, So expect bugs and what not... but great for a base lol
